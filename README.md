# COVID-Nonpharmaceutical-Interventions

What do we know about the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) for COVID-19 prevention? There have been many recent papers that study and report the effectiveness of NPIs. But it is time-consuming for policy-makers to read these papers and review the study results. It is necessary to build AI methods to automatically extract such results. Towards this goal, we build a sentiment analysis dataset.
The dataset contains 200 sentences extracted from the papers. Each sentence is labeled with two things: (1) what NPI is studied? (2) Is the NPI effective? (“positive” indicates that it is effective)

For details of this dataset, please refer to this [paper draft](https://github.com/pengtaoxie/pengtaoxie.github.io/blob/master/npi.pdf)
